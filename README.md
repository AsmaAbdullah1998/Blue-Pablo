##  Pablo Blue

##### `Pablo Blue` is a blue-inspired label by Spanish artist `Pablo Picasso`. It extends almost between '1904-1901'. During this period, Picasso derived his color material from blue gradients with its light and thick and thin shade. The meditator of the paintings will have varying feelings, it is probably a stage of self-retreat and introspection, a period of deep dive and therefore had to be monochrome, yet it is the most exciting experimental stage in Picasso's long journey rich in experiences from classic to surreal. Hence the question arises `why blue?` The answer to this question raises a number of hypotheses. On which the idea of â€‹â€‹the `project` is based, as the idea of â€‹â€‹the project deliberately explores the blue period in a different way, Since we are in the midst of experiencing the fusion of art and artificial intelligence. We are trying to search for answers to technical questions of philosophical, psychological, and primarily aesthetic depth
What if the blue period extends beyond those years? What would some of the paintings we see today look like outside the blue period? That's where the project took its central idea, and that's where the team was trying to find an answer to artificial intelligence.
And because the launch of this question is general, we will resort to identifying a specific painting that followed the blue period and received wide critical attention, and we will raise this through the problem, and then define practical measures to try to answer the question.
